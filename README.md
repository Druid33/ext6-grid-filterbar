# ext6-grid-filterbar

Filter bar plugin for ext6 grids.

I am not the original author of this plugin. 

This version is compatible with ext6. I fixed some bugs, too. Now, you can use this plugin with more than one rendered grid.

Working example is at sencha fiddle: https://fiddle.sencha.com/#view/editor&fiddle/1v2n

Thanks to autor (Ing. Leonardo D'Onofrio) and all contributors. Original code and lot of information you can find on sencha forum: http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?152923-Ext.ux.grid.FilterBar-plugin
